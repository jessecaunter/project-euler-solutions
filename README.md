# Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains a collection of Python programs I've written to solve problems on Project Euler.

The challenge is for each algorithm to be efficient enough that is solves the problem in less than one minute.

## 1. Multiples of 3 or 5
Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000

## 2. Even Fibonacci numbers
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## 3. Largest prime factor
What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

## 4. Largest palindrome product
Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

## 5. Smallest multiple
What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

## 6. Sum square difference
Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

## 7. 10001st prime
What is the 10,001st prime number?

## 8. Largest product in a series
Find the thirteen adjacent digits in the 1000-digit number that have the greatest product. What is the value of this product?

## 9. Special Pythagorean triplet
A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, *a < b < c*, for which,<br>
    a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup><br>
There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which *a + b + c = 1000*.<br>
Find the product *abc*.

## 10. Summation of primes
Find the sum of all primes below two million.
