# Project Euler Solutions
This repository contains a collection of Python programs I've written to solve problems on Project Euler.

## 1. Multiples of 3 or 5
Find the sum of all multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000

## 2. Even Fibonacci numbers
By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
